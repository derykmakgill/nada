<p><em>Company of One</em> is your official guide to building around the idea that staying small and avoiding growth can be more durable and even more enjoyable than business as usual from author Paul Jarvis.</p>
<p>The real key to richer and more fulfilling work could be to not create and scale something into a massive corporation, but rather, to work for yourself, determine your own hours, and become a (highly profitable) and sustainable company of one. This book explains how to do just that.</p>

<h3>Praise for the book</h3>
<blockquote>
<div class="inner">
<div class="blockquote-text">Ever since starting MailChimp 18 years ago, I’ve always been told that my way was wrong. My way has never been to “be big.” My way was always to “be useful.” My company has become a global brand with millions of customers, over $525 million in annual revenue, and almost 1000 employees united by a single mission to help companies of one and entrepreneurs. Go figure. There&#8217;s not one, right way. Only your way. Paul’s book, <em>Company of One</em>, can help you find your way.<cite>Ben Chestnut, CEO and founder of MailChimp</cite></div>

<div class="blockquote-text">Growth has been hacked to simply mean “more”. More revenue, more customers, more employees, more products, more, more, more. That’s a tragically myopic view of growth. Paul Jarvis will help you open your eyes to a broader, wiser definition of growth. One of learning, one of betterment, one of contentment. There’s never been a more opportune time to launch or run companies that embrace having and being “enough”. The most important ingredient is a new worldview. <em>Company of One</em> can give you just that.<cite>David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Ruby on Rails and founder of Basecamp</cite></div>

<div class="blockquote-text">The default equation of more = better in business isn&#8217;t working anymore.

<blockquote>
<div class="inner">
<div class="blockquote-text">Paul Jarvis beautifully illustrates that “Small is the new big.” It&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s not about how many employees you have (or how many customers you serve). It is about “who” you are working with. This is a revolutionary idea for our times: build your business based on your values. There&#8217;s nothing small about that. This book is a treasure.<cite>Mitch Joel, author of Six Pixels of Separation &amp; CTRL ALT Delete</cite></div>
