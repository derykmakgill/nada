This digital version of *The Story of Operation Atlantis* is the first of its kind, and, I expect given the scarcity of the print text, the only original digital edition that will ever be produced. Since its private publication in November 1968, it—and the plan and story it tells—remained unknown outside of those who knew Werner K Stevens and eccentric libertarian circles.

I myself first heard of Operation Atlantis while on a speaking tour in Greece on behalf of the Startup Societies Foundation. I remember a day trip we took to the crusader fort on Rhodes and a walk with my friend Joe McCinney who told me the incredible story and suggested that a book by Stevens existed, though it was incredibly rare. I've long been fascinated with the topic and resolved to find the text, but despite looking in rare bookshops around the world, university libraries, and private collections, I was unable to find it. If it weren't for the reference in Erwin Strauss's [*How to Start Your Own Country*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Start-Your-Own-Country/dp/1581605242) I would have come to believe the entire thing was a fiction.

And so for several years, my interest in the text would peak and I would spend weeks searching, and then it would drop as I became discouraged that I would never find it. Thanks to the work of the Startup Societies Foundation, I found in 2019 an online article by a man named Roy Halliday who claimed to have been involved in Operation Atlantis. I emailed Mr. Halliday, not expecting a response, but to my surprise and total excitement, he replied immediately, offering to send me the text to scan so long as I promised to return it. Mr. Halliday also sent me a near-complete set of the official newspaper of Operation Atlantis, the Atlantis News, which will be scanned and archived as well.

The present digital edition has been prepared from that text provided by Mr. Halliday, to whom I owe a great deal of thanks for trusting me with his original copies and for putting my long search at an end. The edition has been reproduced in full and typos have been checked thoroughly. A small biography has been supplied by me and all annotations and footnotes are mine. I decided at the outset of the project that readers might benefit from additional context on several occasions. For example, Werner was greatly influenced by Ayn Rand and her philosophy of Objectivism, and several times I have included footnotes to further reading which I believe no doubt specifically inspiried him. That said, they are not his annotations and they should be taken as my own words, not his.

Now, a word on the purpose of this project. Why am I so fascinated with an obscure text about an obscure project by an eccentric millionaire to create a taxless, free country outside of the control of modern nation states? I've thought long about that and there are three reasons that stand out to me now. 

*First, researchers, historians, and private intellectuals might benefit greatly from having access to Steven's own words on the project.* For the first time in decades, they do.

*Second, while Werner's plan failed, the idea of a "startup state" has lived on and remains part of the discussion today.* I care deeply about individual liberty and hope that this rediscovery of Werner's text might help advance that cause.

*Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is the feeling that men such as Werner Stevens are less and less common today.* What ambition, confidence, clarity of vision and devotion to principle must have inspired Stevens to actually take action! What a loss we have suffered that there are even fewer like him today. As Stevens himself writes in the book:

> The vast majority of those who admit intellectual agreement in principle shrink from embracing in practice so radical a solution as Atlantis. 

I hope the rediscovery of this story might remind our armchair intellectuals—who do everything but take action—that men such as Werner Stevens have existed and are indeed possible, and that it is their failures and their successes that move the world forward.

## Werner K Stevens

Werner K. Stevens was a pseudonym for Werner Stiefel, born in Brooklyn, NY in 1921. His family established a soap manufacturing business in Germany, but were driven from the country by Nazis. In 1942, Stiefel, his father, and his brother set up a new business in the United States, Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company. As of 2006, Stiefel Laboratories was the largest privately owned dermatological company in the world, with over 2,500 employees and offices in more than 100 countries. Lubriderm was one of their best-known products. Werner remained president and CEO until his retirement in 2001.

He was inspired by the works of Ayn Rand, particularly Atlas Shrugged, writing in *The Story of Operation Atlantis* that

> only Objectivism shows, in a rationally consistent manner, that the need to be free—to be able to exercise one’s freedom of choice—flows directly from man’s nature as a being whose survival depends on the exercise of his rational faculty...

Despite his relative liberty in the United States, Stiefel was convinced that postwar America was on the same road to socialism which had strangled free enterprise in Europe and the Asia. To preserve his own liberty and that of other like-minded and capable people, Stiefel sought to "test the hypothesis that a free, capitalist society can exist and flourish in today's world" by physically building a libertarian nation in the Caribbean. Operation Atlantis was thus born.

Stiefel passed away in 2006.

## Introduction


Operation Atlantis is a plan of action, not a philosophical treatise. Nevertheless, action without purpose or direction is worse than no action at all. The Berkeley rebel who cries, "Strike first, think later" negates the very essence of man as a rational being.[^fn1]

Where, then, are we going in Operation Atlantis? By what compass do we steer? What is our underlying philosophy?

The answer, in one word, is: Liberty—that elusive dream for which men have fought and died since the dawn of history.

We acknowledge that the battle for liberty will ultimately be decided in men's minds. The only long-term hope lies in converting enough to the cause of freedom so that the current worldwide drift toward statism may be slowed and ultimately reversed. We actively support this principle in every way we can.

In this philosophic struggle, no one person in recent years has done more in behalf of the cause of freedom than Ayn Rand. We acknowledged gratefully the very large debt that Operation Atlantis [^fn2] owes to Miss Rand and the Objectivist philosophy she created.[^fn3] At the same time, it should be noted that Operation Atlantis is entirely our own, without any sanction, express or implied, from Miss Rand or Nathaniel Branden.[^fn4]

We acknowledge that many who embrace the cause of freedom arrived at that philosophic milestone by other routes than the Objectivist one. To us, however, only Objectivism shows, in a rationally consistent manner, that the need to be free—to be able to exercise one's freedom of choice—flows directly from man's nature as a being whose survival depends on the exercise of his rational faculty.

It is not inconsistent to support the philosophic struggle for liberty while simultaneously planning the launch of a new, free, independent nation. It we fail, the ideal of liberty will not therby be diminished. But if we succeed, there will exist a working model of a truly free society for all the world to see. Nothing is more persuasive than reality.

The real purpose of Operation Atlantis, however, is on a vastly smaller and more personal scale: freedom now. It's that simple. If we have the means and the vehicle to live in dignity as free men, why endure a day longer than necessary the onerous encroachments on liberty that exist throughout the world today? [^fn5]

As lovers of liberty we are by definition libertarians. Unforutnately, this word is not in wide usage today. In many minds it carries dubious connotations, perhaps because the resemblence to "libertine." To lay this ghost, thereforce, here are Webster's words: "Libertarian—one who upholds the principles of liberty, especially of thought and action." As libertarians we are in good company. Who could fail to be proud to be a kindred spirit of the philosophers like Aristotle and patriots like Patrick Henry?

Another word we use often herein—for want of a better one—is 'government.' Its normal usage implies a master-servant relationship, where someone rules, _governs_, someone else. The concept of being governed by someone else's whim is certainly an anathama for libertarians. And yet, we will have a 'government' in Atlantis. The explanation is that we use the word in the sense of a "spokesman for those who voluntarily and individually consent to be spoken for."

We acknowledge the contributions made to the concept of Operation Atlantis by dozens of libertarians with whom we discussed it. Without their support and encouragement, these words would never have been written.

## Chapter 1: The Evolution of a Concept


Let me state clearly at the very outset: I think America is the noblest, the most free, the greatest country in the world. I love her and what she stands for with the simple devotion I think most Americans of my generation feel for their mother country. When I travel abroad I am always proud to say I am an American.

I believe the writing of the Declaration of Independence, with its moving statements about man's inalienable rights to freedom, is one of the most exalted episodes in history.

And yet, precisely because of my intense love for my country, I am anguished by what I see happening to her: things never visualized by the Founding Fathers, things directly antithetical to the very essence of the American dream—the dream that unleashed man's creative energy to a degree never before approached.

However, to love uncritically is to love immaturely. Love is said to be blind, but blind love begins to be something other than love and implies the abrogation of man's ability to discriminate right from wrong. [^fn6]

America is indeed great, not because she is America, but because of what she stands for—or stood for.

As this is written I am 47 years old. This means I experienced the Great Depression as a teenager. I even remember the devaluation of the dollar in 1933, although of course its significance was lost on me at the time. I witnessed within my lifetime the complete demonitization of our currency, the growth of rampant government intervention in our once free economy, the monsterous sequelae of the antitrust movements, the birth of social security and the welfare state, the massive conscription of our young men to fight in the far corners of the globe for ill-defined reasons, the cancerous growth of the coercive labor movement, the emergence of the Big Brother consumer protection movement—in short: in the incredibly brief span of 30 years I have witnessed the progressive abandonment of the very heritage of freedom that caused America to become great.

Having witnessed this ravishment of the American dream, then, what responses are possible to the concerned citizen? The concept of a new country called Atlantis did not spring full-blown into being: one does not make a neat quantum leap from problem-awareness to pat solution in one stupendous flash of insight. Rather it would be more accurate to say that the Atlantis idea was the only response that was left after a long and painful process of elimination.

It has since become apparent, through hundreds of conversations, discussions, classroom hours, reading hours, and cerebration, that this process of elimination (1) is rather typical, almost classic, (2) takes anywhere from five to ten years, (3) leads usually to the same conclusion. The evolution is so characteristic that it may be traced through a series of stages:

1. The problem awareness stage
2. The hand-wringing stage
3. The political activist stage
4. The back-to-the-drawing-boards stage
5. The philosophic cult stage
6. The 'let's emigrate somewhere' stage
7. The Operation Atlantis stage (or similar movements).

An astounding number of Americans has gone through one or several of these stages, only to become hung up along the way for a variety of reasons: indifference, laziness, moral cowardice, or genuine philosophic disagreement.

The vast majority of those who admit intellectual agreement in principle shrink from embracing in practice so radical a solution as Atlantis. Usually they fall away because they feel, often without actually facing it, that the game is not worth the candle: life is short and things, while bad, would have to be a lot worse before such an extreme course would be warranted. A lesser number feel that the difficulties are so great as to be insurmountable in practice.

And they may be right. Certainly those who have embraced the Atlantis concept are not infallible. There is a good chance that we are either wrong in the concept, frail in execution, or inadequate to prevail against the establishment. On the other hand, we just might pull it off, and if we do it will be because, as has often been pointed out, an idea that has reached its time is not to be stopped.

It is precisely for these reasons that Operation Atlantis was launched: to test our concept. Any hypotheses are sterile until put to the test. Only history is the ultimate arbiter.

It might be instructive to examine each of the above stages briefly. Mostly for sport we have entered after the heading of each stage the number of Americans we estimate to be found on that stage at the present time.

*1. The problem awareness stage (50,000,000).* Anyone who reads the newspapers beyond the comic strips cannot help but be aware that the rapid changes taking place in our country are not all changes for the better. Occasionally this awareness even creeps into high places: witness the President's commission for establishing a national purpose. Editorials and letters-to-the-editor give further evidence. Having abandoned individual liberty as our goal, we are left with a mushy mixture of altruism, the public interest, freedom maintained by force (yes, this is said with a straight face), and the mixed economy.

*2. The hand-wringing stage (25,000,000).* Many who are genuinely concerned about America's progressive loss of freedom are moved to do something about it. Most often this "something" is confined to commiseration with others of the same persuasion. Countless Rotary luncheon conversations, after-dinner speakers, serious discussions among sincere people, and Wall Street Journal editorials have accurately pin-pointed various aspects of our fall from grace—only to stop there with comments like, "What's this country coming to?" We quickly find in our circle of acquaintances those who share our concern. We confine our discussions of the problem to such people, eagerly citing to our fellows the latest example of the growth of tyranny in the land. With a mixture of indignation and almost ghoulish delight we strive to be the first to inform our friends of the latest infringement of liberty. Were steel prices rolled back? Is each employer now an unpaid tax collector? Have the welfare recipients marched in violent protest against insufficiently generous benefits?

With new acquaintances we hastily change the subject unless our first delicate conversational tendril meets instantaneous positive response. 

The purpose here is not to be critical of all this verbal hand-wringing, unless perhaps of the accompanying faint-heartedness. Awareness of the problem ono a wide scale and accurate definition ofo its nature are absolutely essential forunners of corrective action. Certainly discussion helps bring about clarification.

*3. The political activist stage (2,000,000).* Having become, first, aware of the problem, second, concerned about the state of the nation, and third, assured that many of our neighbors are of like mind, the American's typical response is political action. We have great faith in our democratic institutions, our system of checks and balances, and in the innate wisdom of the people. We are confident that the problems will be solved if we only elect the right individuals to represent us. Accordingly we work long hours at election time, ringing doorbells, distributing pamphlets, wearing buttoms and bumper stickers, and getting people to the polls. Often we succeed and the "right" man is elected.

What happens? With a very few heroic exceptions, the right man quickly goes wrong. Why? Typically, often without his conscious awareness, his thought processes go like this:

1. I can only fight for what's right if I'm in office. Out of office, I am powerless.
2. Therefore, my first job is to get re-elected.
3. Getting re-elected means pleasing the majority of my constituents. 
4. Human nature being what it is, the majority of my constituents wants something for nothing.
5. Therefore I must play the Robin Hood role to a certain extent, or else the voters will elect my opponent who is much worse about these matters than I am.

This yielding to expediency has been going on since the dawn of democracy: witness the Romans opening the public graineries to the poor, the British guaranteeing universal good health by legislation. Of course a sincere few do not compromise—and are promptly retired from office.

After going through one or more political disillusionments of this nature many people realize that they are tilting windmills—fighting the wrong battle in the wrong place with the wrong weapons. This is indeed a sobering though, and leads the more thinking individuals to

*4. The "back to the drawing boards" stage (500,000).* At this point we begin to have the first faint misgivings about the adequacy of our democratic tools to cope with the basic problem. Can it be that *Vox populi* is not always *Vox dei?* How do we cope with a majority that expropriates the property, or even the very lives of the minority? Is it possible that 20 million Frenchman *can* be wrong?

Eventually we redicover a basic fact that the Founding Fathers took to be self-evident, but that we have long forgotten: constitutions are written to protect Man against Government. It is Governments historically that are the enslavers of man.

We are finally driven to consider, in the abstract, the fundamental question: "What is the *proper* relation between man and society (government)?"

If we apply ourselves honestly to this question, we find the answer not difficult to come by or to comprehend. (At this point many of us received a philosophic helping hand from Ayn Rand, although the Objectivist route is by no means the only one that leads to the ultimate insight.) We find that, in the last analysis, MAN NEEDS VERY LITTLE FROM GOVERNMENT and it all boils down to this: to be left alone and in peace while he pursues his private interests, so long as his pursuits do not infringe the freedom of others, or vice versa.

*5. The philosophic cult stage (100,000.)* Having achieved this glorious insight—truly and without question the most profound and most basic of all sociological truths—our seeker after liberty now finds that the clean and the simple again give way to the murky and the confusing. For, indeed, it is always easier to perceive a philosophic Truth than to apply it to the problems of day-to-day existence.

He finds the camp of the libertarians divided into factions engaged in bitter dispute and internecine warfare. He is dismayed to learn that sharing a fundamental philosophic belief does not suddenly turn all men into John Galts, and that sweet reason does not automically prevail, even in the camp of the Objectivists who almost deify rationality (and properly so).

The basic question dividing the lovers of freedom turns out to be: just how little government, if any, should the ideal free society have? Our wanderer joins the debate and eventually finds himself most at home in one of the several fragmentary libertarian groups.

The debates here, just as above, serve a useful purpose, although they do sometimes resemble the arguments of the clerics of old who were concerned with precisely how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.

*6. The "let's emigrate somewhere" stage (5,000)*. Two debilitating considerations—the dissention in the libertarian ranks and the hopelessness of convincing enough Americans of the gravity of our country's danger—frequently cause the sincere libertarian to give way to despair. Not all people, particularly not Americans, are content to work quietly and patiently for a millenium only his distant descendents can hope someday to enjoy.

At this point many flirt with the idea of emigrating to another country. If only they could find the freedom they yearn for, they would even be willing to give up many of the amenities of the American standard of living! Australia? Liechtenstein? Canada? It does not take much research to discover, however, that none of these nations are even as free as America. With all our Big Government we still enjoy more of the basic freedoms than any other civilized country on earth.

Withdrawal then? A South Sea island? A remote fastness in the Canadian north? A life of a rootless nomad, self-sufficient and aloof? This alternative is both admirable and idealogically pure. For the flint-hearted few, withdrawal is without a doubt a satisfying and rationally consistent solution. The American pioneers did it, and built the world's greatest nation in the process. Today, however, no unclaimed territory is left and there is no hope of avoiding the heavy hand of the state over the long pull. Let a remote withdrawal community ever begin to thrive and we can count on Atilla's agents appearing on dogsled, Form 1040 in one hand and a tommy-gun in the other.

And so we are back where we started: frustrated but powerless.

*7. Operation Atlantis (and similar programs) (???).* A 20th century Atlantis was conceived as a possible way out of this dilemna. The only free places left on earth are the high seas. Is there a possibility of creating an artificial off-shore island somewhere? A place to which lovers of freedom could repair but still remain part of the world scene? A place where we could

a. Enjoy the blessings of liberty for ourselves;

b. Test the hypothesis that a free, capitalist society can exist and flourish in today's world;

c. Prosper as individuals and thus enjoy the standard of living 20th century man is entitled to by virtue of his technological heritage.

Certainly such an island is technically feasible. "What man is capable of conceiving he is capable of doing." But how to go about it? Where to begin?

That is what Operation Atlantis is all about.

## Chapter 2: Government in a Free Society

Viewing the entire sweep of human existence on this planet, one sees in the dawn of civilization man completely at the mercy of the tribal chief. If this worthy's ulcers gave him an unpleasant night he could and did have two virgins and a potential rival done away with before breakfast, just to make him feel better. Looking into the ultimate future, on the other hand, it is possible to discern man as a magnificent individualist creature, free from arbitrary rule of any kind, his liberty limited only by the reciprocal liberty of his fellow man.

And where do we stand today? Opinions will of course vary, but it would be reasonable to place us about 50% of the way home. We are still slaves to the extent that the tribal chief extracts about 35% of our output as tribute, still impresses us into his service against our individual wish, and still, as a matter of principle, places the "public interest" (what is that?) above that of the individual.

In the debates that rage in the camps of the libertarians, one error keeps recurring, that of attempting to accomplish too much too fast. A great deal of time is spent debating questions like:

* Is a police force necessary, or is the free market-alternative of private guards ideologically purer?
* What is an acceptable alternative to our present judicial system, which depends for its operation on the power of subpoena, an obvious infringement of freedom?
* How can aggression be repelled without having any army, which carries with it the danger of a military coup?
* Can authority and sovereignty as governing principles be supplanted by the institutions of property rights and the law of contracts, enforced by public pressure operating through the free markets?

These and similar questions are obviously of the greatest and most fundamental importance. They are questions which must one day be answered. But the point that is lost sight of is that, even if the precise details of the ideal libertarian society could be worked down to the last comma, such a society could not exist in today's world of sovereign states. If our brave new society were too foreign to the existing scheme of things, it would be cast out by the rest of the world, just as the human body's immune mechanism rejects foreign proteins.

Even more important is the fact that the smooth functioning of a society depends on habitual acceptance by the citizens of customs of day-to-day life. In other words, the importance of habit is often not fully appreciated, since it is impossible to think through a new response to all of the thousands of situations that occure in our routine lives. There is an upper limit to the rate of change which any biologic system can handle, whether it be an indvidual cell or an entire society. A perhaps overly simple analogy is acquiring a sun tan. Six hours' of exposure first thing in the spring will produce a very serious burn. After several weeks' of sunning, however, six hours are easily tolerated: the organism has accomodated. In an analogous way, it is extremely doubtful that, in one generation, a society could make the transition from the world as it exists today to the ideally free Utopia. Too many attiudes of mind and too many habit patterns woudl have to be changed over night.

Just as the American colonies rooted their society in the traditions of English common law, so must Atlantis carry over large portions of American mores in order to function at the beginning.

At this point in the discussion the purists and the idealists retreat in alarm. Having witnessed the suppression of freedom in America, they are understandably concerned about making the same mistake all over again.

There is no doubt that this idealogical debate should continue. New concepts must be conceived in the mind before they can be born into practice. There is great evidence, however, that the time of crisis is at hand. We may not much longer be able to forestall action while we indulge in the luxury of debate. Five years from now it may be too late to act. Even now the statists are discussing ways in which the seashore nations can divide up the high seas among themselves. The territorial limit has already been tacitly extended from three miles to 12 miles, and mineral rights to the edge of the continental shelf.

A wise general once said: "In an emergency, any quick intelligent action is better than delay in search of the ideal." Who would would deny that a state of emergency exists with respect to freedom in the world today? Elder statesman Arthur Krock's new book, "Memoirs: Sixty Years On the Firing Line"[^fn7] will give ample information to convince anyone who may still harbor hopes that the statist tide can somehow be reversed. 

These considerations prompted us to launch Operation Atlantis now. Our confidence that we will be able to avoid the growth of statis power that has characterized all nations to date rests on two simple concepts:

1. The libertarian philosophy which underlies our program
2. The pro-freedom bias we have built into our operating scheme (constitution).

Let us discuss each of these in turn.

*Underlying philosphy.* Social systems cannot be static: they must change, must evolve, to adapt to changing circumstances. At any given instant in time a society is either moving forward toward freedom or reverting backward toward altruism-collectivism.

What determines the direction in which a society evolves is of course its underlying philosophy. No constitution, however strong or well-conceived, can guarantee freedom or prevent men from voting themselves into slavery. Likewise, no tyranny, however oppressive, can continue to enslave a people which believes in liberty and which holds a reality-oriented view of life. The philosophy which underlies a society is like the force of gravity which inexorably pulls a drop of water into either the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean, depending on which side of the continental divide it falls.

In the history of man to date, no society has ever achieved sufficient freedom to escape the relentless tug of the statist mentality. Consequently all societies have seen their freedoms gradually slip away until finally, in a confused and bloody whirl, dictatorship emerged as the only remaining stabilizing force.

When a society is born it carries within itself a genetic code of what it will ultimately become (unless there is a mutation due to war or insurrection). An example is the U.S. constitution: a magnificent document and a sublime achievement in the history of man in his war against the State, but a constitution which nonetheless carried within itself the seeds of our country's ultimate downfall. When you give the government the power to tax, and at the same time give to elected officials the power to dispense the booty so expropriated—under these conditions the decline fromo freedom to statism is inevitable: it is programmed in fromo the very start!

When discussing a society's underlying philosophy, it is not sufficient to say that it is individualist, or freedom-oriented. These are concepts at least half way along the philosophic syllogistic chain. In other woords, we must ask ourselves *why* freedom is good.

It is in this area, perhaps, that we owe our greatest debt to Ayn Rand. Only Objectivism shows that the need to be free flows directly from man's nature as a being whose only means of survival is reason and whose highest value is life. To be able to exercise rational judgment, man must be free. Similarly, in the field of economics, freedom means *laissez-faire* capitalism.

In summary, then, the underlying philosophy of Atlantis is that man must know nature in order to master her in the interest of his own survival; that reason is his only valid tool in aquiring this knowledge; and that man's code of ethical behavior should be evolved rationally rather than accepted mystically.

For a detialed exposition of this reality-reason-oriented philosophy, the reader is referred to any of the textbooks on Objectivism.[^fn8]

*Pro-freedom bias.* Where we are today is less important than the direction in which we are moving. If a society is to evolve in the direction of greater freedom, its constitution must carefully avoid any device that the statis can turn to his advantage in seeking to aggrandize his power. Quite on the contrary, it must consciously be written in such a way that a positive bias toward freedom exists.

It is often the case that homely proverbs carry great truths, and this is certainly true of: "Who pays the fiddler calls the tune." No central authority can grow in power unless it first grows in revenue. If government has no (or severely limited) financial means, it can neither hire the mercenaries to impose its authority by force, nor dispense largess and thus win support from the moochers.

The Atlantis constitution thus devotes more attention to spelling out fiscal restriction imposed on government than to any other aspect of the man-government relationship.

Actually, the constitution of Atlantis does not exist as a formal document today. This is one of the tasks that will be undertaken at the Freedom Forums which are held informally at Atlantis I on Sunday afternoons. It should not be a difficult task to draw up our constitution, for the basic principles which underlie it are well established herein. It need be only very simple and very brief, as the government has so few powers that a half-dozen paragraphs should suffice to define them. All other powers the government does *not* have, i.e. they remain with the individual. 

Operation Atlantis makes no claim that it is creating the ideal libertarian social system. We do believe, however, that our country will be significantly more free than any other in the world today. We beleive further that Atlantis will gradually become even more free as the years pass.

We thus hope to force all lovers of freedom to face up to a decision. Will you stay in America and watch your freedom melt away with each passing day, or will you join us in Atlantis and help us make it ever more free?

## Chapter 3: The Economics Of Operation Atlantis

In considering a nation's economy at least three major aspects should receive attention: money, government finance, and the "private sector" (as the statists like to call it). In all of these areas we must never forget the underlying concept, which is Liberty. Every time we are tempted to say "This is the way it's going to be in Atlantis," we are in fact revealing a carry-over of the coercive thinking that is so much a part of our daily lives at present. In all but a very few cases, the most we can say is that all economic activities are to be freemarket, non-coercive, and beyond that—leave it to the free market.

### I. Money

The Atlantis constitution prohibits no individual or group from issuing notes or any other form of money. Furthermore it does not require that any money so issued be backed by any commodity of value whatsoever. The degree to which these various circulating media take on value as a media of exchange will depend, of course, on the free market's assessment of the reliablity of the issuer.

By the same token, the Atlantis Treasury may also issue money. The Treasury has no power to insist that its money be legal tender for private transactions between citizens. It may and does require, however, that all transactions between citizens and the government be in government money. 

The unit of money issued by the Treasury is the Deca. It is a sterling silver coin weighing 10.0 grams, and may be issued as such only by the Treasury. Sterling silver is 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper, and has a melting point of 920° C. The late lamented American silver coin was 90% silver and 10% copper.

Atlantis permits unlimited coinage of silver. Anyone who brings to the treasury 10 grams of silver bullion 999 fine may exchange it for one Deca. The 7.5% copper added helps offset the minting cost.

There is no restriction on the melting or exporting of Deca coins. However, the Treasury does not guarantee to redeem Deca coins in 999 find bullion, although this may be done under certain circumstances.

The Treasury may issue paper money, but it must be backed 100% in minted decas, or 92.5% in 999 fine silver bullion. The same is true of all token coins of small denomination. If technology renders precious metals no longer precious, then paper money must be backed by other articles of value, such as stock certificates. 

The Treasury does not deal in foreign currencies, gold, or other precious metals or alloys. It merely:

1. Coins into Decas all 999 fine silver presented;

2. Issues paper money and token coins, and redeems them with Deca pieces on presentation.

When the Treasury mint needs to buy silver, copper or alloys, it buys them from private dealers and pays in Decas. If the prospective seller refuses Decas, the Treasury buys dollars (or other money) with Decas in the open market, then buys the metal with the money so acquired.

The minting of Deca coins will begin very early on Stage I.

The Bank of Atlantis is a private bank and among its other banking functions, deals in foreign currencies, making a commission on sales either way, usually 1%.

Thus, for example, when the price of silver in the world market is $2.40 per Troy ounce, one U.S. dollar will buy 1.28 Decas (D1.28). In the reverse transaction, one Deca will buy .764 dollars (76.4c). These exchange rates are posted as often as required in the bank's offices, usually daily.

It is readily seen that a commodity-based money like the Deca flucuates continually *vis à vis* the other currencies of the world. This variation is not objectionable internally, the primary objective being to protect the citizen against expropriation of his wealth by the hidden tax of inflation.

On the other hand, floating currencies work something of a hardship or at least an inconvenience, on merchants dealing in foreign trade. For this reason, even on Stages II and III we may well find that our traders will be carrying out their transactions in dollars or other foreign currencies.

A further, even more persuasive reason—at least in the early years of Atlantis history—is that people in foreign countries will probably be discinclined to accept Decas in payment for goods, nor will they readily be able to purchase Decas in their local banks for the purpose of buying goods in Atlantis.

Even while on Stage 1 it is probably that transactions within the Atlantis community will more and more be carried out in Decas, although there will be no restrictions against using U.S. dollars—or German marks, for that matter. The great appeal of the Deca is that it is money of intrinsic value, a fact of considerable importance in these days of 4% and 5% dollar devaluation per year. The degree to which transactions carried on within Atlantis I are handled in Decas, i.e. the degree to which Decas come into current use (become currency) will depend on the range of the goods and services available for purchase. The individual residents of Atlantis will express themselves through the Free Market regarding the importance, in their own scheme of things, of protection against inflation vs. the convenience of a universally accepted currency.

### II. Government finance.

We decided in the previous chapter that Atlantis needs at least a token government in the context of today's world. Our country must be recognized by other governments so that our citizens may travel and do business abroad. Since we obviously cannot grant our government the power to tax (the basic root—route—of governmental aggrandizement) the question them becomes: where does the government get the revenue to operate even its moodest apparatus?

Some writers ono this subject have proposed voluntary contributions, but our consideration of this alternative leads to the conclusion that it is not practical.

Miss Rand speaks of a national lottery, plus a system of fees paid by parties to contracts if they wish the contracts enforceable in the courts of the land. She goes oon to point out that msot economic transactions are in fact contracts, such as the payment of wages for work performed. In spite of our profound respect for Miss Rand's genius, we do not find these proposals appealing because the payment of such regular fees, perhaps even withheld from paychecks, smacks too much of taxation in veiled form. The very regularity of these payments evokes allergic response in citizens previously sensitized by the repeated insult of the tax collector's expropriations.

Michael Oliver, in his provocative book *A New Constitution for a New Country,* proposed a system of quasi-voluntary payments, the regular remittance of which would entitle the payer to the full services of the central government. Non-payers, for example, would not have access to the courts as plaintiffs, but would still have free protection by the military. Here again we have the argument of disguised taxation with the central government able to raise the ante and thus increase its powers. Let it never be forgotten that the American people voted themselves the yoke of the income tax in 1913.

It appears too us that no system of regular payments, no matter how cunningly devised, can prevent the gradual increase of the periodic "service fee" and consequent aggrandizement of the central authority. The only feasible answer is threefold:

1. To avoid all forms of regular payments;

2. To program the fiscal operations of the government in such a manner that a continual bias will exist in favor of contraction rather than expansion of the government's "services."

3. To give each person the individual choice of becoming or not becoming a citizen. (Only in this manner can one avoid the contradiction of a free person being bound by a constitution framed and adopted by his remote ancestors and never ratified by himself.)

In Atlantis we have come up with a solution which is deceptively simple, yet which meets all of the above criteria. It is contingent on the government's being very small, as it could not possibly cope with a monstrosity the size of the U.S.: federal, state and local—and therin lies the beauty of our concept. The government obtains money from three sources:

1. All real estate as well as all less tangible assets such as radio and television frequency allocations, belong to the government at the start. They are sold to provide citizens at arms-length prices as circumstances warrant.

2. Each person born in Atlantis must decide, upon reaching the age of 21, whether or not he chooses to become a citizen. If he decides in the affirmative he swears to uphold the constitution and pays a one-time "admission-fee" of 1,000 Decas to teh government. This is the one and only tax-like payment he will ever be called upon to make. If he decides negatively he is thenceforth a foreigner and must pay (if he wants to stay) the regular residence fee paid for all aliens.

3. The Atlantis constitution also provides that the government may in certain circumstances collect fees from litigants for the use of the national courts.

All monies collected from the above three sources (and all other sources, such as gifts, bequests, and the proceeds of lotteries) become part of the government's Capital Fund. The Capital Fund is invested at interest and the government's expenditures may not exceed the income so generated. The government may under no circumstances dip into the principal.

Since no part of the Capital Fund is even refunded, it will obviously grow in size as the generations pass. Eventually the point will be reached where the interest income exceeds the sum required to operate the government. At this point the government begins paying out the excess to its citizens as a quasi-dividend. Since all citizens will inherently desire an increase in such cash payments, a built-in-bias exists in the direction of curtailing government expenditures.

The Constitution provides that the National Assembly must each year vote by open ballot on whether or not to commence paying such dividends. The size of the dividend, once begun, may not be reduced in subsequent years except by national referendum requiring three-fourts concurrence. The Constitution further provides that the National Assembly must vote by open ballot each year on whether or not to increase the level of the dividend above that previously established. All such dividends must be paid to all living citizens equally, except that where there has been a financial award in a court case by due process, the court may direct that the losing citizen's dividends be paid to the winning litigants. This procedure is preferable to the seizing of property for damage claims, as prevails in the U.S. today.

Departments of the government, which receive appropriations from the federal budget (which must, constituionally, be balanced at all times) may choose to keep spending below the amount received, investing the excess at interest. Thus, for example, the Army may build up a war chest.

Numerous safeguards exist in the Atlantis constitution regarding the management of the government's fiscal affairs in general and the handling of the Capital Fund in particular. For example:

1. The Capital Fund is invested at interest in Atlantis industry only to the extent of 5% of any corporation's net capital and, of course, only if the corporation wants such investment. This investment does not entitle the government to any voice in the management of the company affairs. The Capital Fund will thus serve among other things, as an important source of capital, contributing directly to the increase  in the standard of living of the citizens. Each company desiring such investment need not publish statements of its financial affairs if it does not desire to do so, but must establish by certified public accountant that its net worth is at least 20 times as large as the amount of its bonds purchased by the government, The government investments are a first lien against the assets of the company.

2. The government may not at any time or for any reason borrow money or own property.

3. All revenue bills passed by the National Assembly must bear an automatic expiration date not to exceed five years.

### III. The Private Sector

What should be the form of organization for economic activity in Atlantis: the individual proprietorship? the limited partnership? the corporation? other yet-to-be-developed organizational forms? Once again, that is not a question for us to decide. The free-market may be relied upon to render its incontrovertible verdict.

In the area of land usage it has been suggested that Atlantis operate as a proprietary community. All the land would be owned by a Company, which would then lease it to individuals and other companies. The revenues derived from rents would be used to improve continuously the efficiency of the land usage, and the profit motive could be relied on to produce this effect. Rights flowing from property ownership would replace coercive powers flowing from sovereignty as is the case in the U.S. today. There would be no need, for example, to resort to such strong arm methods as eminent domain, as land usage patterns could be readily changed as leases expire. Urban blight's primary cause would be eliminated.

The proprietary community (of which industrial parks and shopping centers are presnet day, albiet truncated, examples) is indeed an appealing concept consistent with our underlying philosophy. Atlantis on Stages I and II will be organized along these lines. On Stage III, however, there may be citizens who, for reasons adequate to themselves, prefer to own land in fee simple. Shall we abandon our principles and deny them this right simply because of our affection for the concept of the proprietary community? Obviously not: effective land usage is a problem the free market can easily handle, provided no coercive interference from government thwarts its workings.

Considerations like the above bring us appreciation of the free market's exquisite beauty as a device for regulating man's economic affairs. At one stroke we eliminate from the statute books 99% of all the law relating to commerce. Gone is the need for the SEC, the FDA, the FHA, the IRS and countless other alphabetical agencies. No wonder the fiscal needs of the Atlantis government are small! No wonder we can expect our standard of living to soar as hordes of parasites are returned to productive activity!

## Chapter 4: The Program in Detail

Operation Atlantis will be accomplished in three stages:

Stage 1. Dry run (already in being);

Stage 2. Floating ocean community;

Stage 3. Permanent, fixed development.

The design criteria of each stage are simple:

1. It must be directly prepatory for the following stages;

2. It must be able to be converted without excessive cost when the time comes to move on to the next stage;

3. Personal and financial risk at each stage must be kept to a minimum consistent with the objectives.

Since the parameters of each stage are dictated by the needs of succeeding stages it is obvious one must start with a clear description of Stage III and then work backwards. The nature of Stage III is in turn determined by the objectives of the entire Operation Atlantis program, which may be summarized as follows:

1. To form a new and independent nation capable of functioning in the context of today's international scene;

2. To make sure that the fruits of man's technological evolution are available to its citizens. In other words we fell that the undercapitalized wilderness retreat concept, while attractive to many people, represents an unnecessary sacrifice and is a wrong turn on the road to the ultimate objective: a society that is both free *and* highly prosperous.

3. To accept at first, to the extent necessary, certain minor restrictions on perfect individual freedom, so long as it is sure that our society is so programmed that it will inherently tend to evolve in the direction of ever increasing liberty.

Thus when Stage III is fully achieved, Atlantis will be an independent nation with fixed, permanent geographic location or locations. It may be any one or a combination of

1. Artificially constructed islands,

2. Existing islands which may be purchased and

3. Other land areas which could be purchased as were Alaska and the Louisianna Purchase.

The construction of artificial islands in international waters presents no difficult technical problems. For example, the city of Los Angeles has conducted feasability studies on the construction of an artificial island airport. This proposed seadrome would be 10 miles off shore in water 240 feet deep. It would be a monsterous three-deck affair, with five-mile roof runways capable of handling tomorrow's jumbo jets. Its cost is estimated to be comparable with acquiring a similar amount of on-shore real estate the same distance from the city.

The purchase of islands or other land area is also feasible today, though probably not from Uncle Sam or the other affluent nations. When Russia sold Alaska she was desperately in need of funds, and certainly nations with this problem are plentiful in the world today.

Ultimately it is probable that Atlantis will comprise several locations, perhaps even widely separated ones. With transportation and communication as provided by present and future technology, such geographical separation will present no problem.

Having visualized our ultimate objective on Stage III, it follows almost self-evidently that Stage II should be aboard a ship cruising or anchored in international waters and putting into port in time of storm, for supplies, and for other necessary purposes. Such ship should be a modified freighter of sufficient size so that it can be used later on, on Stage III, as the first boat of our merchant fleet, keeping us supplied and transporting our products to foreign nations.

The feasability of Stage II as an independent shipboard nation is readily appreciated when it is remembered that the large cruise ships are in reality floating cities, with populations of many thousands, and all 20th century conveniences on board. Adding light industry, so that our citizens could make a living, is also entirely feasible. Some industries, such as banking, insurance, publishing, research and tourism require very little plant in relation to income generated.

As everyone knows, the city of Long Beach bought the *Queen Mary* for $3.5 million—a large sum, perhaps, but by other standards a bargain price for a ready-made city. She will be anchored off-shore as a convention center and hotel.

It is of course not mandatory that Stage II as such occur at all. We may be able to leapfrog directly from Stage I to Stage III. The important point is to have a general feasible plan of action, and thereafter to remain flexible enough to modify it as circumstances at the time may require.

As to Stage I, the Dry Run stage, how can we best simulate and prepare for Stage II? Listing first our objectives at this point:

1. We should live, to the extent feasible, in the same relationships as will prevail when we are an independent nation on Stage II. This will involved, as we say in industry, a certain amount of role playing and the mental adjustment and habituation that accompany it.

2. If the entire operation appears unfeasible it should be possible to terminate the project with little or no financial loss or personal stigma. In other words, Stage I is not the stage for burning our bridges.

3. Similarly, individuals who suffer a change of heart should be able to opt out at their convenience, without financial loss or damage to their careers.

4. As many as possible of our institutions—commercial and governmental—should be reduced to actual practice within the group. Not only must we define who will do what when Stage II is launched, but each individual should actually be doing it and have achieved reasonable proficiency. Thus "transition trauma" will be minimized.

From these conditions, then, the exact nature of Stage I follows almost inevitably. It should contain a certain number of "staterooms" as living quarters,

![Atlantis I](/assets/images/Operation-Atlantis-Motel.png)

<cite>The Atlantis-Swayerkill Motel, first property of the Atlantis Development Corp., and site of Atlantis I. View from the northbound lanes of Interstate 87 (Thruway). Taken 8/30/68.
  
some larger rooms where people can gather, plus unused space where places of employment can be constructed.

Accordingly, on August 30, 1968, The Atlantis Development Corporation purchased a small motel with three acres of vacant land adjacent. The motel at present contains only 14 rental units, but can readily be expanded as required. It also has a central lounge plus a four-room apartment for the manager and his family. Finally, there are adjoining cottages and bungalows which are available for purchase as needed. It is readily apparent how closely a motel simulated a land-locked ship.

The Atlantis Development Corporation will operate the motel and adjoining properties as a profit-seeking venture. To the extent they are not permanently occupied by members of the Atlantis community, its rooms will be open to transients in the manner normal to the motel business.

The character of Stage I Atlantis will change as it matures. In its early days all members of the community will doubtlessly have employment "on the outside" in one of the surrounding towns or cities. Their Atlantis employment will be in the nature of moonlighting with one of the Atlantis companies, on a part-time basis, evenings and weekends.

Gradually, as the Atlantis companies grow and we attract new industry, an increasing number of persons will have jobs in establishments physically located within Atlantis I.

Finally, just before Stage II is launched, we will all have internal jobs, and Atlantis will be an integrated community with a balanced economy: the raw materials, food, and other items we "import" will be paid foor with money earned on the goods and services we sell on the outside, supplemented wiht income earned by "foreign" investments.

At this point we shed our chrysalis and move to Stage II. Our personal belongings and industries are moved bodily to the vessel which is Stage II. In all liklihood the motel will then be sold in order to provide capital for purchasing the Stage II ship. On the other hand, if finances permit, it could be retained as a kind of staging area for future recruits. Again, circumstances at the time will dictate.

A similar move to the Stage III location occurs when title to the land has been firmly secured and all aspects of international law have been complied with. (A tongue-in-cheek question: shall we then aplly for membership in the U.N.?) An important feature to note is that each stage is self-sufficient in itself and is bound by no rigid timetable. The move to the following stage is made only when all conditions are right.

The next natural question to arise is: how many people are required on Stage I before the move to Stage II can be undertaken? There can be no precise answer to such a question, because it is contingent on the per capita income and capital available. For example, a single, well-to-do person with adequate income from investments (or a writer) could buy a boat and do it all by himself. As a matter of fact, newspaper accounts regarding one such individual appeard several years ago. Similarly, if the Rockefeller Foundatioon chose to underwrite it, a 2000-person colony could be launched in short order.

On a more practical plane, preliminary calculations show that there are three order-of-magnitude requirements:

1. Capital. In a modern society, a total capital investment ofo perhaps $25,000 per person is necessary. This sum includes factories, homes, schools, roads, stoores hospitals, etc, that we take for granted. In the U.S., of course, many of these facilities are publicly owned, while in Atlantis everything will be privately owned. The approximate total capital required, however, remains the same.

2. Income. Even though we live in Atlantis by taking in each other's washing to the maximum extent feasible, income from the outside will nonetheless be required to purchase abroad those goods and services we do not desire to produce ourselves. This required income must come from value added in Atlantis, i.e. not the difference between the cost of exported finished goods and the imported raw materials. Value added can vary over a wide range, from 100% on items like income from foreign investments, doown to 25% or even less on certain types of manufactured goods. From whatever source-derived, however, net value added in Atlantis ought not to average much less than $3000 per person per year, which would very roughly give us a standard of living (on the average) equal to that possible with per capita *income* (not value added) of perhaps $6000 in the U.S. today.

3. Skills. A community should be large enough to support all of the critical skills. For example, we should have a doctor, even if he spends a considerable portion of his time doing other things than treating patients—research, for exmaple.

To take a figure out of the air, suppose we had 100 people: men, women and children. Our capital requirements, then, would be of the order of $2,500,000—certainly not an impossible sum when one considers that it includes the net worth of the Atlantis Development Corporation, plus the net worth of each of our citizens and all of our industry. Value added by our citizens' efforts would have to be aruond $300,000 per year: again an entirely feasible amount. Note that we are speaking throughout of average income and investment. Distribution on an individual basis will undoubtedly be in accordance with the usual bell-curve.

The first four basic business ventures required in Atlantis I right from the very start are:

1. Bank of Atlantis

2. Atlantis Development Corp.

3. Atlantis Trading Company

4. Atlantis Publishing Company

As this is written, two are already in active existence and the other two are well along in their organization. All of them are organized as corporations under Atlantis law, while some will be registered as U.S. corporations as well. Stock in all of these companies is available for purchase by interested persons. In addition, it is expected that many residents will want to start ventures of their own, such as a school-university, writing for profit, part-time landromat, etc.

It is worth stressing at this point that on Stage I we are all American citizens, subject to American law, even though we concurrently evolve and live under Atlantis law (to the extent that it does not conflict with American law). We will lean over backwards to comply scrupulously with all aspects of U.S. law. We will not encourage participation in demonstrations, protests or other activities no matter how appropriate. Such political activity, while a legitimate vehicle for change in a democracy, does not contribute to our primary objective, which is Operation Atlantis. In fact, if any of our members engage in activities which bring them into conflict with American authorities, our entire project could therby be jeapordized. At all times on Stage I we wish to be loyal, docile, law-abiding citizens in every respect. Accordinly the development company will not lease space to individuals who wish to be activist in American affairs. The logic is that we are here in Atlantis because we have concluded that it is hopeless to think in terms of meaningful fundamental reforms in the U.S. To dream of repealing laws like Social Security, federal income tax, and Medicare is just simply not facing up to reality.
